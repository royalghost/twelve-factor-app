# Implementing The Twelve-Factor App

The Twelve-Factor App is possibly one of the best resources available to developers working on building Software as a web service.

This is programming language or technology agnostic. 

# I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

# II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

# III. Config

[This demo](https://github.com/royalghost/springconfigserver) illustrates using Spring Cloud Config Server to store configurations

# IV. Backing services
Treat backing services as attached resources

# V. Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages

# VI. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

# VII. Port binding
Export services via port binding

# VIII. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model

# IX. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

# X. Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

# XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams

# XII. Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
